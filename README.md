# Voltcraft-co2-raspberrypi

*under heavy construction* 

In this project I show how I used the Raspberry Pi to read CO2 information (and other environmental data) from the Voltcraft CO50 device.

Credit where credit is due:
This project relies heavily on the work of others (big thanks to you!): see references.
The python code is my own but the wiring and the information on the communication protocol are not.
